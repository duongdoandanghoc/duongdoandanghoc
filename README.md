- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Duong Doan,
  I am a third-year student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, driven by a lifelong passion for unmanned aerial vehicles, which led me to pursue the Smart Embedded Systems & IoT program at HUST. Although I have limited practical experience, I actively seek opportunities to learn and enhance my skills through academic projects, some of which I have shared on GitHub.

Alongside my foundation in embedded systems, I have a continuous drive for innovation fueled by my love for reading and exploring new advancements in technology. I have basic proficiency in C/C++ and Python programming, working with microcontrollers, signal processing, and device connectivity. I am always looking for opportunities to grow, participate in real-world projects, and take on new challenges.

Beyond my passion for technology, I enjoy playing sports, especially football and badminton. I believe that sports not only improve physical health but also help develop teamwork, agility, and strategic thinkingâ€”essential qualities for effective collaboration in a team environment.

With a strong eagerness to learn, a creative mindset, and an energetic lifestyle, I aspire to work in a modern technological environment where I can contribute to smart solutions and continuously develop myself in a well-rounded manner.
